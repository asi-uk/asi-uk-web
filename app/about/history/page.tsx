                    <h3 className="heading-sub">The Roots of ASI: Madison College</h3>
                    <p className="pb-5">The story of ASI begins on a warm summer&lsquo;s day in June 1904, when a
                        steamboat called the <em>Morning Star</em> pushed away from the landing dock in Nashville,
                        Tennessee, and headed up the Cumberland River. On board was a small group of explorers, among
                        them Ellen White and her two sons, Edson and Willie White. Beside the helmsman stood E.A.
                        Sutherland, an educator, innovator, and missionary trailblazer. They were on an expedition to
                        find suitable land for a new kind of missionary training school.</p>
                    <p className="pb-5">Sutherland and his partner Percy Magan had just left their positions at Emmanuel
                        Missionary College in Berrien Springs, Michigan, to embark on this new venture. When the <em>Morning
                            Star</em> broke down a few miles out of Nashville, the group found themselves providentially
                        beside the Ferguson-Nelson farm near Madison &mdash; a large but unpromising spread of land that
                        had previously served as a slave trader&lsquo;s headquarters before falling into disrepair.</p>
                    <p className="pb-5">Ellen White urged Sutherland and Magan to purchase the property, telling them
                        she
                        had seen it in vision. They were reluctant &mdash; the land was rocky, overgrown, and would cost
                        $12,000, of which they had only half. After spending an entire day in prayer, they were filled
                        with a peace and courage that never left them. They purchased the property for $11,000, and in
                        October 1904 the Nashville Agricultural and Normal Institute &mdash; soon known simply as
                        Madison
                        College &mdash; opened its doors to its first cohort of just eleven students.</p>

                    <h3 className="heading-sub">A New Model for Mission</h3>
                    <p className="pb-5">Madison College was unlike anything the Adventist Church had seen. It combined
                        education, healthcare, and agriculture into a single self-supporting operation. The school
                        functioned like a large family: it was not unusual to see Magan, the college dean, ploughing
                        fields with a team of mules, while Sutherland, the president, churned butter for sale in the
                        nearby town. Students who could not pay tuition in cash worked six hours a day on the farm or in
                        one of the college industries instead.</p>
                    <p className="pb-5">This model of self-supporting mission produced remarkable results. Within a year
                        of the school&lsquo;s founding, graduates began going out to establish their own outposts.
                        Groups
                        of Madison alumni banded together to form small self-supporting institutions fashioned on the
                        same model &mdash; schools that served their local communities by offering literacy classes for
                        children and health education for adults. By 1915, there were 39 such self-supporting groups
                        spread across Tennessee, Alabama, and North Carolina, forming a growing network of lay-driven
                        missionary enterprises.</p>
                    <p className="pb-5">At the heart of the Madison model were several key principles that would come to
                        define ASI: faith in God&lsquo;s word and willingness to sacrifice, innovation and
                        entrepreneurship within the context of mission, and the vital importance of an empowered and
                        engaged church membership sharing Christ in everyday life.</p>

                    <h3 className="heading-sub">The Formation of ASI</h3>
                    <p className="pb-5">In 1947, the expanding network of self-supporting institutions inspired by
                        Madison College joined together under the guidance of the General Conference to form the
                        Association of Seventh-day Adventist Self-Supporting Institutions, or ASI. At the time, ASI
                        membership consisted solely of educational and healthcare organisations.</p>
                    <p className="pb-5">During this official formation meeting, frequent reference was made to Ellen
                        White&lsquo;s statement: <em>&ldquo;The work of God in this earth can never be finished until
                            the men and women comprising our church membership rally to the work, and unite their
                            efforts
                            with those of ministers and church officers&rdquo;</em> (Gospel Workers, p. 352). This
                        conviction &mdash; that lay people and church leaders must work hand in hand &mdash; became the
                        foundational principle of the new organisation.</p>
                    <p className="pb-5">Over the following decades, ASI membership grew to include businesses, Adventist
                        entrepreneurs, and professionals from all walks of life. To better reflect this diverse
                        membership, the organisation&lsquo;s name was changed in 1979 to Adventist-laymen&lsquo;s
                        Services and Industries, with the motto: <em>Sharing Christ in the Marketplace</em>.</p>

                    <h3 className="heading-sub">ASI Today</h3>
                    <p className="pb-5">Today, ASI is a global force for mission. From banana farms in Zambia that fund
                        education and evangelism, to lifestyle health centres in Tennessee and Georgia, to small
                        businesses in Kentucky and Minnesota whose owners see every customer interaction as a divine
                        appointment &mdash; ASI members around the world are combining their professional skills with a
                        passion for sharing the gospel.</p>
                    <p className="pb-5">ASI exists to network, equip, and empower these individuals and organisations.
                        Through annual conventions, financial assistance, and mentorship, ASI nurtures innovation in
                        mission within the Adventist Church. In many ways, the organisation still embodies the vision
                        and
                        values that were the hallmarks of Madison College and its founders: faith, innovation,
                        self-sacrifice, and a deep commitment to sharing Christ wherever life takes you.</p>

                    <h3 className="heading-sub">ASI in the United Kingdom</h3>
                    <p className="pb-5">The ASI concept was introduced to the Adventist Church in the British Isles in
                        1983 by the then British Union Conference President, Harold Calkins, and his Vice-President,
                        John
                        Arthur. They invited ASI members from the United States to meet with interested business and
                        professional lay people in Leicester. During that weekend, the first overseas chapter of ASI was
                        formed &mdash; a historic milestone for the movement.</p>
                    <p className="pb-5">In 1990, the UK chapter&lsquo;s name was changed to the Adventist Business and
                        Professionals Association. However, following the formation of ASI Europe in 1998, it was
                        decided
                        in 2006 to change the name back to ASI UK, bringing it into line with other European
                        chapters.</p>
                    <p className="pb-5">Over the years, ASI UK has been actively involved in evangelistic initiatives
                        and
                        humanitarian projects, maintaining strong links with ADRA and the British Union Conference of
                        Seventh-day Adventists. The chapter conducts workshops and seminars and continues to attract
                        young professionals and those starting out in business to the Association, ensuring that the
                        next
                        generation of Adventist lay people are equipped and inspired to share Christ in their
                        marketplaces.</p>
