these ASI oci type of supporting Ministries in the world um I I'm not going to share my story here you could hear more about it on audio verse um I shared at an ASI convention one time but um yeah it was a a vegetarian restaurant in Switzerland there was a a family a family farm Ministry in Italy uh plus Eden Valley in Colorado Wildwood in um Georgia U oci headquarters which was in Tennessee all of these played a significant role before I was baptized and join the church so I knew about ASI

and I knew about oi actually at the same time that I really found out what the seventh day evst church was everybody that every avenus that I knew were were uh missionaries in the supporting Ministry work uh it's changed my life um I was trained in these Ministries and have been serving for 25 years at different projects um between Wildwood light organization oci and serving on a lot of different boards and and being able to help uh a lot of Ministries overseas and so forth so well this a passion for me and I I do

have a lot to share but I'll try to be concise with it that there's of course going to be a lot more that could be said uh but I think it's very important for us to know our Roots uh what is the role of the supporting Ministry work this is a question that I uh have to answer to church leaders around the world uh many pastors many lay people what is the supporting Ministries are it's not so common in in many other countries it's way more common in the US but um why do we have them is that is

that a necessary thing um aren't they just independent they're are they against the church are they working they think they know how to do things better differently uh what's the purpose in it so to answer all those questions uh for the RO to understand the role and the purpose I think you have to really understand the history of it where it comes from and um and I think so that's anyway that's what I want to go through a little bit of a historical perspective let me just share a few slides here

while I while I'm doing that history of supporting Ministries yeah and if you have a question just just type it in there in the chat and I I think C will help keep track of those uh very interestingly the history of supporting Min Ministries begins with two conference workers Percy McAn and EA Southerland um these were the two men that started the very first supporting Ministry pro project um that had such a huge impact in the church and is is still having a a Major Impact I would just give a brief outline I could give a

whole hour just on the life of of EA subin in the early years but I'll just say briefly um EA suin was um was born to a a new an Adventist family that were fairly new Adventists they they were living in the state of Wisconsin and while his mother was pregnant with him they were traveling to Northern Iowa to start a new life there and um um he was something very interesting I just want to I just want to throw in here his parents for some reason I don't know why they decided to travel uh when when his

mom was N9 months pregnant but uh I don't know maybe it was the bumpy carriage ride or or what but she went into labor um halfway through this this travel and EA SN was actually born on the Mississippi River uh and that would have been on a on a ferry because they he he crossed at prayer desen there was no Bridge uh at that time but they did have a fery service and EA suin was was uh the record goes that he was born on the Mississippi River so he's he's recorded as being born in PR to Sheen

Wisconsin which is only about an hour south of where I was born and raised in Lacrosse Wisconsin right on the Mississippi River and on well anyway on top of EA suland being born um in travel not having you know a place to go it's interesting his parents' name were Mary and Joseph I thought that was kind of ironic or a little humorous uh part of the story there so imagine Joseph and Mary not looking having no place to deliver the child he wasn't born in a major but he was born on a fery uh

crossing the river and anyway so so suin was was uh raised in Northern Iowa on a farm he his parent his father was a farmer there and very Godly home was raised the right way uh prayer uh devotions uh worship and so forth forth uh was strong in his family and as a young man he he he found an opportunity to do some Co portering in Minneapolis and so a little bit part of the story there this this lady her name is Mrs godson she is he stayed at her house she was a millionaire um she found out about

avenus from the Battle Creek sanitarium her husband who had started a huge business selling books and and shoes in Minneapolis tragically passed away uh leaving her with the uh with the inheritance of the business and so forth and she was one of the strongest um uh philanthropist of of the of that area era for the church not only in supporting Ministries but but even for the church and she and souin kept contact and she really helped uh with the Madison School in many ways so that was like a lifelong connection just as a

young teenager he made with her and while he was with her co-p portering for that summer he went to a camp meeting um and hearde uh president Olen the general conference president speaking about Dr Kellogg and a medical school starting in in Battle Creek so uh suland was very excited about that he showed up to Battle Creek long story short they had to cancel the medical school because they didn't have enough students enrolled they only had two it was subtle in in one other person uh but he ended up um studying uh

religion there education um so he was a student at Battle Creek and while he was there he met Percy McAn Percy McAn was an immigrant from Ireland who was uh re also recently converted to the church to the to the message and um he was staying in the home of Ellen G white so souin and Manan were both mentored by Ellen White while they studied at Battle Creek they became lifelong friends together um and upon graduation uh souin got involved in in teaching um he he helped with several different schools But ultimately

got called back to Battle Creek to be an Old Testament teacher uh now there's a big story here I'll just summarize really quick uh suin that summer had become a vegetarian and um because Percy was an influence in his life on that direction and so uh in teaching Old Testament he was teaching the original diet from from Genesis he was teaching about the diet of the Hebrews uh as they left um e uh Egypt and so forth um so he started to teach that well he got kind of in some hot water with these two men

uh ww Prescott on the right was the school uh president for batt Creek College he he was not pleased that that suin was was teaching this because the students were stirring up and now they wanted the cafeteria to change um Elder UAH Smith as well the the the publishing review and Herald uh director he he was not happy either and so they called suin into the office and and and just kind of reproved him several times but the students were um he had I think 80 of his students wanted to be vegetarian and

then it it grew and there was a petition of 150 students at Battle Creek that were petitioning for the for more for vegetarian food to be served because it was it was just it was all meat you know in the cafeteria to that time so uh they agreed anyway to uh introduce beans in into the the menu so you know we can credit EA suin for um you know laying the foundation for many Hast Stacks to be to be served uh for generations to come and uh for those that may not know Hy Stacks that's like a taco salad it's

very just very common here I don't know maybe in your country but uh beans began to be served there at Battle Creek that was a little bit of southerland's influence there um but you know when in that experience he made really a good impression on these two men the one on the left of course that's Dr John Harvey Kellogg um sometimes we see pictures of Kellogg you know I would say most pictures we see of Kellogg with a gray beard and ol guy a white suit sometimes with this like a parrot or bird and a

walk a cane he he he was not really uh in the church in any of those pictures this is how uh Kellogg um looked while he was was um you know in the church and was the sanitarium director medical director the on the right is was General Conference president Olen he was impressed with souin and uh the these two men got together and and uh decided it was a good idea to place a call for Southerland to leave Battle Creek but to go help start a new college in Washington called waa Wala so suin uh and you know what they they gave him the

call and you know who did not disagree with that call or these these gentlemen they supported that idea they said oh yeah yeah that's a good idea suin should go go uh to the West Coast um so they that wasn't it wouldn't be the last interaction with with uh Elder Prescott but um it was definitely the beginning of of that relationship so souland was sent out west to wala wala this is a whole another chapter but uh just in brief suin was very successful there he got the school started the building

project complete he started different Industries um because he wanted the school to become self-supporting financially he was reading Ellen White's councils on that and um he developed a new curriculum that was less classical and more bible-based um the students were working half day and studying half day as well as the staff um he was really trying to implement uh the you know the the councils from the testimonies um this is going on at the same time that Ellen White was in Australia uh establishing the Avendale

school which is also following those good principles um well suin was so successful at waa that when he was called back to give a report at the general conference um in sorry I don't have my notes in front of me so I'm kind of going by memory on all this I don't have my presenter notes but I I I I believe it was 1897 when he was called to the general conference session he gave a report about his work at at waa Wala well the other uh College Presidents had also reported from Union College and um and

uh uh Battle Creek college and these these college were in significant debt in fact Battle Creek was in in today's currency would be in $2.5 Million worth of debt um at that at that time it was $90,000 it was a very significant sum Union was also in debt amazingly the only College uh in the North America territory that was not in debt was wala wala and uh res after his report showing what he was doing and and the philosophy and and so forth he was he was called you um to come back to to Battle Creek and take over the

leadership um yeah good question there I appreciate that I've noticed that too this who is the lady in this picture she must have been a very powerful lady to to get in this picture with all these uh all these men of the general conference I I haven't been able to find an answer to that question but if you look at the front row uh on the right you see stepen hasell you see Jorge Butler um many characters here part of the the the general conference so they're the ones that called Southerland back to Battle

Creek and this is another chapter um while Southerland was at Battle Creek he appealed that that the school be sold and moved to a country to a farm oh that didn't sit too well that that didn't go anywhere until 1901 when Ellen White herself came to a general conference session this is a picture of her giving the lecture where she recommended that indeed that happened that the college be sold because it really should be placed in the country originally it should be placed in the country it was actually

never intended to be built in Battle Creek um and so uh while the Brethren uh finally agreed to do that it was not an easy decision they sold the college and moved it to a Farm property which was a very you know it was a move by faith it was a very significant move um but it's what they needed to do um I think it's maybe interesting to just to note while that while the college did what God was calling it to do there was trouble at the review and at the sanitarium that they were not following the councils the

very next year both of those institutions burned to the ground um the college did not burn uh because it was it was uh in process of being moved so um you know I think yeah I kind of wonder if if if the church did not um follow God's counsel to move the college I wonder if it may have also burned who who who knows I'm just I'm just saying you know uh maybe you know but anyway the college was moved to a to a farm um and and on this Farm they had almost they had almost no infrastructure

they had to build up this this little temporary building for some for some of their classes uh but they worked very hard and within a year they built this building here on the farm which is amazing how fast these guys could work in that era um uh they worked very hard this is the campus of um Emmanuel missionary College which is now Andrew University in Baran Springs look at look at the difference of and and this picture here is taken in 1932 uh the college was moved 30 years prior it it was just a big Farmland

imagine moving from the sanit huge sanitarium the general conferences there the the the publishing house and this beautiful brick College building moving from that kind of environment out to a farm it was it was a very significant move um many people questioned the the sanity of that move uh but souin was very determined he he was not easily uh swayed from what he felt God was calling him to so he came in and established the program planted fruit trees got their Dairy going with their milking cows got

their uh vegetable gardens going had the students all working halftime studying halftime and he was implementing the program uh but you know um he now this is how he got into self-supporting work because you know anyway many people were not too happy many parents were complaining that this the style of Education they didn't understand it it was a huge transition for for many in their thinking uh so there was there was a lot of complaining about it uh at the same time suin really um had a missionary heart he always wanted to go

to the South where there was very few Adventists living many Northerners did not want to go to the South you know there was Prejudice the the economy was broken down there um there there was not really any uh prospects for for for northerners to to move down to the South um so as a result not not many missionaries not many lay people were interested to go but there was souo recruiting his students to go down there well and Ador I I I'll I'll keep this part short you know there there were some

disappointments there were some heated discussions and so forth but in the end souin and McAn both resigned their positions at the Emanuel missionary College um feeling that you know if the church maybe the church wasn't ready uh to implement all of the uh what they envisioned Emanuel missionary college to be for example one thing they really wanted to see was a sanitarium built there but you know they wanted the whole model with the sanitarium the school the farm they wanted all of that um but the

the the church told them no you know that they weren't going to do a sanitarium that was a hard no um difficult for them to swallow and it was because of all the feelings of Kellogg I mean the the Battle Creek sanitarium really ended up to be really a disaster of a situation and and so there there were obviously reasons for that but in the end suin uh and Manan moved manan's wife suffered greatly and even died under stress of the whole situation um so they celed with sister white and she encouraged them that you

know uh the Lord would guide them she didn't tell them what to do but they felt called to the South she encouraged them uh to go ahead and do that so they went down south but now they had resigned their positions so they were not Church workers anymore they were not on Church salary they were now lay people just wanted to do missionary work in the South and Ellen White said I'm going to come down with you so she and her sons Willie white and and Edson white um went along with them to the

South to start a certain special kind of missionary work now that year was 1904 and the Southern Union was the smallest Union in the United States they there was a very sparse population of Adventist uh for the reasons that I've already given um Edson white was was operating this boat the morning star that was doing missionary work down in the South um and so Ellen White py McAn ea suland uh they all traveled down south and were looking at properties outside of Nashville um because that is where you

know it was the biggest city of the South it was the most influential and God just directed uh through the the testimonies that this would be the place that that we start but not in the city it was an outpost to the city God directed to a property 8 miles outside of Nashville where Madison College was founded um here's a picture of the Madison College and its Founders uh at in the front row are is the white family Willie uh Ellen Emma and Edson in the back are the team uh Percy McAn uh second on the left EA suin with

the bow tie on uh in the middle and his aunt who's a very strong lady Nelly drulard she was helping there at EMC in Michigan they they were all coming from Michigan um uh she anyway that lady was also very wealthy and Ellen White told her if she in her older age would help these these young men to start this project she will have done more in her life than her than her entire all she had done in her entire life to that point she took that to heart and she helped also sell properties and help

Finance to get this project off the ground um Ellen White negotiated the property uh there was Vision given regarding the property itself and how it should be established um there there was a charter written up for a nonprofit organization Ellen White agreed to sit on the board of directors the only board that she ever sat on um which was very significant she knew the work this type of work might not be understood or might be criticized she wanted to show full support for it she wrote several letters

to the general conference and its leaders asking them to support ell suin and what he's doing down here Madison was established to train lay people to do miss missionary work in the south in particular and that was it was through the testimonies told that it was a model school that should be replicated around the world and if we were to follow this kind of model of training lay people and doing medical missionary work educational work um ultural work and and the whole you know following the

messages that God has given to us that the three message would go quickly to the whole world and Jesus would soon come so Madison was really a template to be replicated at it wasn't just a a once off kind of initiative and it was the very first self-supporting institution and it was working in harmony with this organized Church um there was some progress to make that's why Ellen White wrote so many letters to for the Brethren to understand you know the uh the purpose in it all but uh it even had

someone from the general conference on its board right from the beginning that would be SN hasell it also had George Butler previous General Conference president now at that point in 1904 he was the Southern Union president so the local union leadership was involved on the board so two church leaders plus suin McAn Ellen White um so they they had a very strong board I was say I don't think I've ever heard of a board as strong as that one um so it had good a good foundation people willing to

sacrifice they had vision and Madison uh was was launching into existence now if there are any questions I'm happy to uh um you know answer them I'm not seeing too many there how do I get a copy of this meeting uh maybe Curtis can answer that at the end um I can't remember if these are recorded or not um Curtis you can you can chime in is this a a recorded presentation yeah thank you it will be on the OC ASI website wonderful okay so yeah I'm glad you're you're uh interested and we've got a great turnout

tonight so I hope you're enjoying the story here because it's it it really is just a big a big story of of the history of God's church one part of it but to really this history is an unknown history to to most 7th Day Avenues worldwide and most church leaders at the general conference there's a lot of knowledge about this but as you travel around the world there's very little so um this is the house of the Madison property it was a a big Farm property with one Farmhouse they did everything

out of here so if if some of you listening here might be thinking to start a project and you can look and see some big projects around the world but you know most of them started with one house um Wildwood started with one house Ichi Pine started with one house Eden Valley started with one house Madison started with one house it it always starts small and God helps these Ministries grow over the years um this house was where the staff lived it's the cafeteria it's the office it was the the

meeting place it was the school it was it was the chapel it it was everything except the dormatory was was much worse the dormatory was in the barn which was they called it uh probation hall if you could survive the probation hall you were ready for the mission field they had to clean out uh pigs and livestock there was rats and and bats and uh flies and had to try to clean the whole thing out and get rid of all these these uh these animals and the and the students were living there in the beginning of

course they um they grew from there and were able to build dormitories and so forth but they were Pioneers sacrificing in the beginning yes Madison started small they started simple and they did not wait they started soon those are three s's for getting involved in Ministry start small start simple keep it simple and start soon this is the principle that m started with um and here's a a picture of some of the graduates early graduates and the staff because they had a convention um after

five years of Ministry they pulled many of the graduates together the school at that time had about 50 60 students in it they would spent about one year there and then they would go off and launch to start another some more Mission projects and in the first eight years they started 12 different missionary centers many of them were pretty close by but back then nobody had a car so the distance was actually you know several would take several hours to get to each one of them because you're you're riding

on horse and buggy um and so each of those was like a a school kind of serving that their own local area they were doing uh medical work educational uh agricultural uh you know little little small farm schools kind of like like pictured here um two two of the schools were were more focused for um African-Americans you know recognizing there was we have a lot of testimonies that um on the southern work to to help the situation you know of especially in the South where there needed to be more education and try to

help bring more Independence um you know following up from from slavery and so forth avenus were were leading out in much of that work and and Madison was focused on it as well um Madison's education and and program was very simple it was a three three uh fold approach uh the ABCs of Education was the AG culture that was sustainability that was the the it was good it the students all had to work on the farm there was also a lot of other Industries then they had the education they were training teachers and they did

the medical work so students got a a well-rounded education and practical Hands-On you know learning and of course educational gospel and medical that was was that was the Madison program here's a picture of students working out in the fields uh harvesting there on the Madison Farm uh they had started a health food industry these are some of the products that they um sold there in Nashville and Beyond different kind of cereals nut Meats um nut roast laxative fruit sticks you don't see that very

often laxative fruit sticks so uh those were some the products of the early days there a whole whole uh wheat raisin there some sort of bread I don't know if you're supposed to bake that or what so very interesting H history there nut steak okay all canned foods also Madison had a vegetarian restaurant in Nashville here's the U the picture of it where they also had uh treatment rooms they even put it on the sign which is interesting Ellen White talked about treatment rooms being used at our

restaurants um so they had that they had the model that they were using it um this is a picture of the sanitarium that they built um souland and Manan both took medical training in Nashville while while they're also leading out in this whole project don't know how they did all that but then they opened up the sanitarium and uh it was a flourishing you know Ministry uh was healing hundreds of people uh the school was educating hundreds and it grew into thousands um and here's a picture of some of the

early graduates from their from their course you had the the nurses it it eventually grew into a two-year nurses school but it didn't only have nursing they had other programs you could study practical um different industrial skills they had nursing they had education they had you know they had uh religion this was their um assembly of the students there so uh I also want to just point out how ific they they were in farm production 1931 this is the depression during the Depression the college did not close it continued on um

it was one of the few colleges in the in the United States that that was still continuing regularly that this was kind of unheard of at this time it was a total crisis in the United States 1931 uh people were starving I mean people were hungry Americans were eating out of garbage cans in the cities uh there was high unemployment uh before the depression I think unemployment was like 2% and it had skyrocketed to 25% it was it was a horrible part of US history but meanwhile at Madison their life did not change very much their

businesses on the outside went down they had less cash flow but they had plenty of food and um that that year they they they preserved 3,000 gallons of peaches 1,000 gallons of string beans 2,000 gallons of beets 4,000 gallons of of uh greens and so forth so they were they were they had a huge operation there and the college grew and and it got noticed by towards the end of that decade the world was uh uh was noticing Madison 1938 Readers Digest publishes this article um the following year Ripley

Believe It or Not puts an article out the president of the United States wife Elanor Roosevelt wrote an article the US Department of interior uh uh wrote also a bulletin on them on this on this very special self self-help College which which they called it this resulted in thousands of applications from around the United States from people that were not even 7th Day avenus wanting to attend Madison College they they maxed out their capacity at 450 students on the campus the place was buzzing it was

really a a peak of Madison though there was risks some involved with all of that and uh sadly that Peak it was kind of downhill from there uh it never gained back to that to that to the prominence that it had in in in 3940 41 the start of World War II changed things very drastically um but that year when when um when World War II had had started the this is a report that I that I found with um 47 self-supporting projects that were established from the graduates of Madison these places were called the

Madison units they would come together once a year and share testimonies and reports of all that God had done uh and this is really the very beginning of of ASI so uh let's see here yeah I I have a actually a I'll just scroll through this quickly here are the very um those here are those 4 Ministries that were there in 1942 and many of them of course became um charter members of ASI so little creek and uh Fountain Head some very well-known ones here by maybe some of you Peewee Valley pisga many of these

places actually turned into church facilities Church run places they kind of transition from self-supporting into church run several of them uh Wildwood sanitarium started that very year so Wildwood would be the baby in 1942 um so now let me just share a little history here of of what happened now uh World War II was an eye opening for the need for country living more because many of our church family suffered in Europe mostly that were living in the cities cities were bombed you know um there was there was just all kinds of

problems and one city 57th Aven were killed in a bombing um it was was published in the in the review in Herald uh by a GC official that that said that they they didn't heed the message and and lost lives and so the general conference made a big push for the country living message and you know but they many of them were not so much special you know they weren't specialists in that area our urbanization had really taken hold of the United States and and for many sth day Adventists uh the church grew a

lot in the Great Depression mostly in areas through the welfare work um so yeah they who did they turn to they turned to EA suland and and and Southerland had gotten all this prominence from the world I mean the whole church was now really awake if they weren't so awake uh I you know I can't find hardly any general conference motions or involvement with Madison uh from the days of Ellen White all the way up to uh the 1940s um when when they got all this recognition from the world and everything so they they were pretty

popular then and and the church needed their help so souland moved up to the general conference and helped put together the book country living they published that in 1946 they made a commission on Rural living suin was a part of that as well as uh carile Haynes a leader of the General Conference NC Wilson was a a uh a new president for the general conference that's Elder Ted Wilson's grandpa um and he apparently was a strong believer in country living and and the supporting Ministry work and so

uh they encouraged the commission on Rural living to form an organization that would be called ASI and that was voted by the general conference so um in 1947 the commission on Rural living organized a meeting with uh the general conference President Wilson uh souland uh carile Haynes and and uh all the self-supporting leaders presidents from all of these institutions from around the United States got together in Cincinnati in 1947 and they officially established the association of self-supporting institutions or of

seventh a adven self- supporting institutions uh which they called ASI that is the founding of ASI it was all the Madison units it was all the Madison projects um Wildwood was a charter member of of ASI um not too many around now that are that I think leer uh would be the only other one that was around at that time that that didn't later become a church institution so um but uh at this time you know hey let me let me I just also want to share here that the growth of the work in the South was just

taking off and and there's no doubt that all these supportive Ministries had a huge part in that so as the years went on and the more and more supportive Ministries were were active in in the Southern Union membership also was taking off after especially all of that Foundation was laid and after um you know World War II and all these projects 47 50 Ministries that were healing thousands of people educating thousands of people um membership took off and the Southern Union by 1960 became the second

largest Union in the United States um and uh yes and NC Wilson was the grandfather of Ted Wilson um 2003 Southern Union became the largest Union in the NAD as it is today Southern Union is the largest um in membership and it is the strongest financially I just like to point this out because a lot of people will say hey these supporting Ministries are taking money away from the church not the case everywhere where the supporting Ministries are strongest the tithe is actually the highest Southern Union is

an example of that has the highest tithe income in the world of any Union by far are and it is more tithe income than 10 of the 13 World divisions okay and the if that was true that supporting Ministries took money away from the church and there would be less tithe nowhere would that be more true than the Southern Union but the opposite is true so I don't think there's any truth that at at all people that were touched by these Ministries ASI Ministries um they are the most faithful in tith Pay they

believe in the mission of the church they support the work of the church they also May support these other supporting Ministries but they're supporting the organization as well um praise the Lord for that so this is all the establishment of ASI now ASI in the late 70s uh expanded its membership to include business uh lay businessmen entrepreneurs that were Mission focused and um so they changed their name it's still ASI but it became ASI uh Layman's services and industries um and so today yeah we we

still gathered together just like those all those supporting Ministries from uh around the United States we still gather together at ASI conventions and uh share about our Ministries and what's going on and there's uh some money raised and uh it's very inspiring and it's helping God's work to go forward um God has given counsel for this work he he established this work it's moving forward it's an important part the church is overwhelmed the the church is not going to be respons for all these

different departments the restaurants and the and the lifestyle centers and all these different kind of projects and Ministries that that lay people should be um taking the liability for it's a blessing for the church the lay people take liability Financial legal liability and they do they they support the work on the mission of the Seventh Day Adventist Church we're all part of the same church pressing together this is a part of God's plan to uh finish the work um occi is also a partner with ASI side

but it's got a global reach it's trying to help uh strengthen and grow the the supporting Ministry work around the world and and in many ways it's helping with ASI ASI is only uh organized per division there's no Global ASI so in a lot of places there's there is no ASI and uh O oci is just uh giving support to these to these Ministries um La lastly here I'll just I'm going to try to leave 15 minutes here for for question um just want to encourage the importance of this this graph shows us the the

ratio of ordained ministers to lay people 99.9% of the church are lay members this is the army of God we have got to get church members more active in service we cannot expect the pastors to do the work we've been told this for over 150 years but we're still struggling on it and of course everyone through their business through their work should be should be finding ways to witness for Jesus some lay people are called into particular Ministries some are called overseas to help expand the

three's message to Every Nation Kindred tongue and person this message has grown largely worldwide through the efforts of lay people um and we need to work together we're not to work separately we have to work in unison last statement I'll share one that we should all know 90 from uh page 116 the work of God in this earth can never be finished until the men men and women comprising our church membership rally to the work and unite their efforts with those of ministers and church officers so that's the spirit of

ASI um and uh yeah I'm I'm getting a chance to volunteer with ASI which I love and uh also with oci which is a big blessing and we're all working together trying to revive lay people get more lay people involved help educate the church uh members and and leaders on on the importance of this kind of work uh we believe we need to Rally to the work press together and if we do that we believe that Jesus will come very soon so amen that's what I wanted to share this evening that was a really quick I

want sorry I'm kind of talking fast but I did it's a big there's a lot to say and I did want to leave some time just for reflection and questions so uh thanks Curtis wow well thank you James um this is amazing and I know James when we talked here uh several months ago about your research on this you were telling me so many little interesting details that were so um yeah just amazing how not only God was working in people's lives and you know there's obviously uh things that you shared here

where there was some conflict and things like that how how God worked through that but just yeah um there's so much more you could share I know so thank you for sharing it so concisely here and we do have several questions here so I want to get get right into it here um so I'll start here with a question from Kelvin did any of the graduates start schools outside of the USA I think I you actually had some interesting information on that one one in particular that is just a great story is some of the very first

graduates of Madison two young men that didn't speak any Spanish um raised up some money and and got on a boat to go to Cuba and they're some of the very first church missionaries in Cuba and and uh they they able to raise up a little money and buy a little farm project they started to teach Cubans agriculture these young men were were were professional Farmers um and they started a little church and the work was was growing in Cuba some of the very first missionaries from Cuba were from

the Madison College now in later years many Madison graduates were in in foreign missions and I'm still looking for some statistics but I I met a one of our conference presidents in the Middle East um shared with me uh that he's read statistics where um yeah something crazy where like 40% or a large number of global missionary uh Pioneers were coming from the were Madison graduates this is long time ago but a strong significance but I don't have a lot more to to share on that mostly it was in the United States

uh but but Cuba was another real strong story from the early days and I know there was more after and later years um and of course supporting Ministry work has had a huge impact on on the global work but yeah I I I don't probably have more on that one all right okay next question I heard once that Edson white was founder of self-supporting Ministry only the church was not ready for it and then it's or oragan or and southernland I guess is the question so I don't know if you had any uh any comment on heard that where is

that heard that Edson was the what the Yeah well he was very supportive I mean I think most would really definitely recognize EA settlin as kind of the father of the self-supporting work because he was the the president of of Madison but Edson was right there helping and and they they established a kind of a before ASI there was a little there was a little organization that they had where Edson was involved where they were trying to help with with these with these different projects and and the

supporting Ministry work so yeah Edson was a I don't know if you could call him a co-founder but you know it doesn't really matter he he was highly involved um so yeah Ed Edson was a was a blessing um and Manan and Southerland too but Southerland just stayed with Madison all the way to the end he resigned his position when he went to ASI by the way suin was the first as I president um Manan um after about 15 years at Madison was called by the general conference to help start Linda and it's also interesting that

southernland was helping Lolinda a lot southernland helped raise money to establish L Melinda so it's interesting that the self-supporting Ministry was helping direct money and helping to raise money for the church ministry that God was calling for and and pimag ended up going to Lolinda and becoming the medical director there wow all right uh could you say something about why Madison College went out of existence and what lesson it uh can be learned from its demise so I know this is a loaded question um probably a few

few different persp sure it's one I'm used to so I I think I can keep it pretty uh concise so yeah Madison College closed in 1965 um and you know really it was there was a slow down W uh path from from ever since World War II um Southerland held his presidency pretty long he was in his 80s when he uh stepped aside and apparently he had not they had not done proper succession planning there was nobody within the organization to take over they hired a a conference leader to come in and and try to manage s Madison

after sub and it didn't go well he he stayed one year and was voted out the next year and then they brought another leader in and they voted him out and they started going through leaders really fast there there was some turmoil on campus there was some division uh suin was I would say I think it's fair to say suin was pushing for a four-year senior accreditation for the college and um he was losing support on that the campus was kind of divided it it it caused a lot of tension um they were

kind of losing the early Vision maybe they lost some Focus there was turmoil they started going to debt and suland of course passed away in the early 50s they never really could get back to a Clear Vision uh they ended up getting into significant financial trouble to to the point where they had to basically uh just turn the school over to the to the to the church uh which closed the college and interestingly took the license for the nursing school that Madison have because they did have a they were accredited as

a two-year Junior College just not as a four-year and the junior junior college had a li a licensed nursing school which was given to Southern missionary College which is now called Southern avenus University so the nursing school at Southern avenus University was actually came from Madison wow amazing that's uh yeah very interesting and I remember I remember uh at one ASI in I think 2016 some of this story was shared and Steve Dickman uh had shared the kind of the history of Madison and so on and there was an appeal at the end

where he just prayed that God would continue to raise up Godly leaders and that seemed to be you know there was such a vision that uh you know Southerland had and such a a vision for the work and that needs to continue and we just pray that God will you know give each one that Vision I guess to an opportunity yeah the work move ahead uh next question is there a business model available that we can use to support Church work from our small businesses is there a business model available that we can use to support

Church work from our small businesses um not really sure how to answer that question not exactly sure what the question is really Curtis can you help me with that yeah so I'm just wondering um you know is there and this is really the spirit of ASI and I I don't know if I'm answering exactly the question here but you know the spirit of ASI as time went on um you know with ASI as an organization it was really mainly supporting Ministries that would come together but as time went on and I think

it's the late 70s um you know they started um having a lot of you know people that were interested lay people that were business people that were interested in in helping and supporting the work contributing maybe their resources whether it was building materials finances you know expertise in certain areas to help you know this growing network of of supporting Ministries or some that maybe were struggling as well and so I think that's where ASI has really um embraced this Partnership of you know people that are

in business that have certain skills or resources or connections or whatever uh just coming alongside and partnering with those that are in supporting Ministry work um helping in in whatever way with the resources available and uh so perhaps that's one way that business can be um involved in Ministry um of course then you know any business is a Ministry really and so having the opportunity to share with vendors and customers and and obviously employees so on so again I don't know if that was

quite where the question was going but um maybe that's answer yeah just and just from our our work with the supporting Ministries um and like with oci and the and the nonprofits in ASI we have the restaurant model as as far as direct you know businesses that are used for Ministry the restaurant health food industry the the wellness centers clinics that can be used for Mission work I've seen I've seen physical therapists and different kind of clinics use as missionary centers um so there's models for that we have

models for wellness centers and and and uh health food stores and that sort of thing so on top of yeah you you have to be a little creative for your own business how you could use it for the for the church but um all right we're uh kind of uh running out on on time here but we're going to try and get a few more questions here uh James do you know if any of EA Southerland or percing M's relatives are still around I mean I'm sure there you know yeah they they are um I've met some in fact Curtis I I just

met one at at Fountain View Academy last year oh wow she right yeah she's she's a descendant from of the manans yeah wow amazing I forget I forget her name but her last name was Manan and I asked her I'm like wow are you related to again she like she said yeah I am cool um when I first came in the church I was on a board an old of an old Ministry that yeah there there was a an older man that was a relative of sub and but I I can't say that I've met you know very many um but I was I was privileged

when I came to Wildwood in 2000 there was many people here that were that were students at at Madison in the 1950s um so these men were in their 80s and and women so I got to meet a lot of Madison graduates which was really really neat and they they told me a lot of stories about it all right uh now many of our conference run schools are closing uh listing several there leadership and debt are the problem some alumni are floating the idea of turning it into a supporting uh self-supporting training

school any thoughts on this from ASI oci yeah we were just talking about this a few days ago James I know yes a school in Alabama that was GNA be closing as well and yeah yeah I'm very sorry for many of our church schools that are closing um it's difficult I think we have to stay distinct with our avenus education if we if we lose distinction you know I think many parents don't see the the value or importance of spending the money to send their kids there so you know I'm one that that believes that yeah we need a

avenus education is something that's unique um and if we can hold to that to those principles and and really make a good example for it I I think a school could could survive you know I don't know what to do with bass Academy that's a big that's a big property and a big school and it's had to be subsidized a lot by the church um could a supporting Ministry come in there and run a school maybe but it would take a strong leader a strong team it would take some sacrifice you know not everybody's going

to be on salary you know you you're gonna have to you're gonna have to increase the enrollment a bit because I I I anyway I looked at that situation it seems like you had to increase your number of students you also needed to reduce the amount of that you're paying in salaries um and and you could probably make it but it's not easy can be done but it it it takes some real commitment and sacrifice and hard work and so yeah that's one of the things that really stood out to me James as we close here

you know just as you were sharing kind of the the Journey of of Manan and Southerland and how you know starting I can just imagine you know this you know school out in the middle of Washington you know out in the middle of the Prairie there and you know the perseverance like if if you read the book uh you know Madison God's beautiful garden there just some of the challenges they went through and the sacrifice like you're saying and that you know just how God they had to rely on God for the

determination to go through all these different challenges and so um I really like you know that uh term that we used earlier in this presentation start simple small and soon and you know really is I think part of it maybe maybe it's not possible for like a big Academy that's grown kind of to a certain size to continue at that level a lot of the schools you know maybe staying smaller um and having more of them you know but smaller units um maybe was more along the line of Madison's model as well but

uh anyway some very very interesting things I think you know I just pray that God will there are some schools that are actually thriving that are following this model today and and uh you know I think there is there is counsel that we've been given there's a blueprint and God will bless as we we you know apply those principles and and step out in faith anyway AB time amen yeah thank you Curtis all right thank you James and thank you each one for joining us again this evening we want to make sure we

close our time with prayer here and James would you be willing to to do that for us this evening sure father we are grateful to be reflecting on how you have led in the past and you we are thankful for the counsels that we've been given on education in particular that's what we've been discussing here at the end we are sad to see many of our church schools closing um and we pray though for Revival on on this we we need our this Young Generation to be equipped for service and finishing the work so bless

these schools that are still uh in the battle going forward pray you bless the teachers the administrators and um we we we um but we have faith Lord You Have you have um counseled us on on how the work will be finished with a Revival of the lay members uniting in an organized way with church leaders and we see that happening I I've just seen a huge spike in growth of Ministries around the world way more lay activity than than 10 and especially 20 years ago and so we we sense time is short and I just want to

pray for each one that's been listening here that you would use them show them how exactly what you would have them to do to help support your work whether it's through their work through their business or supporting some other Ministry um help us also to be lifting up your uh this work in in prayer and uh we just thank you for your blessings tonight be with each one and go with us we pray in Jesus name amen amen amen James thank you again for uh sharing this amazing history and uh thank you as well for uh joining us

again here for this this as hourd like to say good good night to each of you or from wherever you're joining us from uh please join us again for next month's ASI hour in the meantime prayerfully consider registering for the ASI convention and uh we'd love to see you there so good night and we'll see you all next month good night thanks everyone thanks Curtis
