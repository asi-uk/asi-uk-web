ASI HistoryThe founding principles of Adventist-laymen's Services and Industries (ASI) are tied strongly to the Biblical principles of lay evangelism that Paul emphasized in the New Testament and Ellen White stressed in her writings: "His (Paul’s) course inspired many humble toilers with a desire to do what they could to advance the cause of God, while at the same time they supported themselves in daily labor… The Lord employs various instrumentalities for the accomplishment of His purpose" (Welfare Ministry, p. 63).ASI was developed out of the Madison College project established by Dr. E. A. Sutherland and Percy Magan in the United States under the direction of Ellen White. Mrs. White felt very strongly that Madison College was fulfilling a specific need within the church. She spoke repeatedly about the role the college was playing in establishing a self-supporting work that would complement and even challenge the organizational schools. "There is a large field open before the self-supporting gospel worker. Many may gain valuable experience while toiling a portion of the time at some form of manual labor…" (Welfare Ministry, p. 64). The self-supporting school was established near Nashville, Tennessee in 1904. Despite struggling at its inception, the school soon grew and began to plant satellite schools and institutions throughout the country. Part of the atmosphere of this burgeoning organization was a yearly meeting that brought all the entities together. Arthur W. Spalding wrote in his book, Origin and History of Seventh-day Adventists, "Once a year for forty years, the schools, sanitariums, rest homes and other enterprises of the rural missions joined in a self-supporting worker's convention held at Madison College" (p. 183). This laid the foundation for what is now the annual ASI International Convention in North America.At the Fall Council of 1945 the General Conference recommended the organization of an association to unify the self-supporting workers and to promote a strong tie with the church organization. In 1946 Madison College and the Southern Union Conference worked together to align the self-supporting units and the church organization. These efforts culminated in March of 1947 when a group of representatives from approximately 25 self-supporting institutions met in Cincinnati, Ohio, for the purpose of organizing the Association of Seventh-day Adventist Self-Supporting Institutions. The association was comprised of representatives of the self-supporting institutions along with General Conference and Union leaders. Dr. E. A. Sutherland became the first president of this organization with Dr. Wayne McFarland serving as the first secretary.Through the years, the association grew and changed, gradually including lay people from outside the realm of supporting institutions. In 1979, the organization’s name changed from the unwieldy Association of Privately Owned Seventh-day Adventist Services and Industries to the more manageable Adventist-laymen's Services and Industries. Today, ASI members represent a unique and diverse cross-section of Adventist laity and are committed to showing the world the love of Jesus.
