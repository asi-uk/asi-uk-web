[Music] [Music] [Music] we live in a global village a melting pot of diverse cultures and ethnicities all converging as a single unified whole from tokyo to toronto from san francisco to sydney every major city of the world is laced with a diversity of food languages and cultural heritage that is amazing but even as we embrace this new sense of global community and connectivity it's important to remember that in the midst of this diversity there is a single thread that binds us closer than geography and proximity

[Music] human beings are all wired the same at our core we all grapple with the same key issues in life we long for answers to life's biggest questions where do i come from why am i here what is right and wrong and where am i going culture language ethnicity personal circumstances all shape our answers to these challenging questions but the questions themselves remain at the core of our collective existence they are universal [Music] how we answer these questions defines how we live our lives in the present

plan for our futures and view our pasts as christians and perhaps more significantly as seventh-day adventists we have a worldview that adequately and intelligently provides answers to life's biggest questions a worldview that provides stability certainty and above all hope and perhaps that's the most significant thing we have to offer the world today hope in her book the acts of the apostles ellen white says that all over the world men and women are looking wistfully to heaven prayers and tears and inquiries

go up from souls looking for light for grace and for the holy spirit many are on the verge of the kingdom waiting only to be gathered in all over the world there are men and women looking for answers and all over the world there are men and women like you who have the answers to the questions that they have people like you who throng the busy market places plying your trade gaining an education mingling with the crowd god needs people like you that will share christ in the marketplace people like

you that will blaze a trail into the deepest reaches of society and offer a message of hope purpose and certainty to those around you [Music] asi is dedicated to networking equipping and empowering people like you trailblazers for the gospel from all walks of life visionaries and innovators who are looking to combine their skills and talents with the unique call god has given to us as his final movement a call to prophesy again before many nations a call to take the three angels message into the marketplace in this generation

join us as we take a closer look at the birth of asi its vision mission and purpose and the ways in which you too can be a part of this trailblazing movement of innovative mission for god on a warm summer's day in june 1904 the steamboat the morning star pushed away from the landing dock here in nashville tennessee and headed up the cumberland river on board was a small group of explorers setting out to find land among them was ellen white and her two sons edson and willie white steering the boat was

helmsman will palmer and beside him was ed sutherland educator innovator and missionary trailblazer the group was on an expedition to find suitable land to build missionary training schools these training schools were designed to deploy workers into the deep south of the united states [Music] on board sutherland and his partner mcgann had just quit their jobs at emmanuel missionary college in berrien springs michigan in order to embark on this new venture when they were a few miles out of nashville the morning star broke down

right near this spot providentially they had broken down on the edge of the ferguson nelson farm a large but unpromising spread of land near madison [Music] ellen white convinced sutherland and palmer to go and see the land sutherland was reluctant he had seen the land before and was less than impressed with his rocky and barren terrain ellen white however was adamant that he needed to go along and he grudgingly obliged when they got to the land ellen white told sutherland she had seen it envision

and this was the land they should purchase for the training school sutherland's heart sank he protested that it was far too big and far too expensive to be considered but ella white remained adamant this was the land when percy mcgann came on board a short while later he too did not like the prospect of buying the ferguson nelson property the land had been used as a slave traders headquarters before being abandoned and falling into disrepair it was the roughest weediest most miserable plot of land that either of them had

laid their eyes on and yet inexplicably god through his messenger was urging them to buy it mcgahn and sutherland had reached a crossroads in their quest to establish an innovative missionary outpost a crossroads that required more than business acumen or entrepreneurial vision qualities they both possessed instead the decision they face require them to take a leap of faith based on divine counsel how would they respond and what kind of impact would their response have on shaping the future of missionary

endeavors in the adventist church at large sutherland and mcgann wrestled with the decision before them to acquire the property would be a step into the unknown against their better judgment and would stake the success of the entire venture on the word of ellen white alone it was a hard sell not because they didn't believe in the divine calling of ellen white but because they were now faced with the task of putting that belief to the test they spent an entire day in prayer wrestling with god and pouring their

hearts out to him they laid out all their challenges the twelve thousand dollar price tag the fact they had only half that amount in their pockets the deplorable condition of the land and the scanty facilities available they laid it all out in prayer [Music] they begged god for help for courage to move forward in faith in obedience with the divine counsel as they prayed they were filled with such peace assurance and courage that from that point forward whenever they faced challenges they never doubted that god had called them

to this place and to this work sutherland and mcgann's faith courage and self-sacrifice were hallmarks of the work here at madison these traits permeated every facet of student life and provided an example for each cohort of students to follow but there was something else about sutherland and megan that was extraordinary they were both innovators uniquely merging cutting edge entrepreneurship with a relentless passion for mission visionaries who had a clear perception in their minds of where they wanted

madison to be how did the madison school come to be established what was his ultimate purpose and what was it that drove sutherland and mcgowan forward in pioneering this work [Music] as madison began to educate young people very quickly there began to be a stream of people from madison going out and starting things they started healthcare institutions they started schools they started elementary schools they started businesses actually they would go out and start a business and soon they would begin a church in their

home and soon there would be building a church in that community and soon they would have a business employing people in a church constructed there and the work of god would be planted in those communities one of the unique things about madison was that it encouraged its students to go where there was no other work happening now today we kind of look at that we go oh that's a little scary to go out where nothing's going on where you can't just go to the church and attend the church and sit in the pew

madison was sending people out who would go into the community and establish a church and build the pews and build the church so that there would be a place for worship madison college was established in 1904 under the direction and instruction of ellen white god directed them to a piece of property there that they really didn't even want to have because it was rocky and the fences were broken down and the equipment was rusty somehow god has this sense of humor he takes the things that look like they

can be used for nothing and he makes something out of them and i think that's what he wanted to do at madison because he wanted to show if you can do mission work here you can do it anywhere it was not beautiful when they went there but it was beautiful because of what it produced young people who knew how to go out and earn a living with their own hands and share the gospel at the same time [Music] at madison college one of the things that was evident from the beginning is that they had to earn their own way

they sold eggs they milked the cows and made butter they farmed the land and whatever they had that they had grown that's what they ate because they knew it had to be self-sustaining if they were going to teach self-supporting they had to do self-supporting it was the template for the program that the self-supporting institution including harvard hills have adopted at harvard hills academy the institution has several major components we have the educational work and the educational work we believe should

include practical hands-on training therefore the industries that we also have harvard hills academy owns a 49-bed nursing home that 49-bed nursing home is a fully licensed and accredited facility in the state of tennessee to provide care for senior citizens who need more care than they can receive at home and outside of the nursing home we have harvard health bread of life bakery where we bake breads and cookies for both the school and the nursing home and students are involved in that work and

then we have a pretty extensive agriculture program we're building greenhouses as we speak and growing vegetables year round and so students are involved in all of these industries that we have on school these are the ministries that help support the school we also have a radio station on campus it's really an outreach to our community but it's also a training tool to help young people in addition to the practical training through the industries we have vocational classes in auto mechanics woodworking and

digital photography and medical missionary and food service teaching them these vital skills that they need for everyday life it's an opportunity for young people to learn how to serve other people how to be responsible how to be punctual how to be dependable how to be good at their job and how to be a servant of any kind i grew up in a public sector where it's all academic i did not have a problem with getting a book work easy but when i went to college and i had to apply that to other things i could not do it

it was hard for me because that practical application was missing here at harvard heroes we teach the practical application along with the academic how it can reach one so your mind can reach the highest standard so our goal is that our students whether they go in the mission field or whether they continue on to higher education is that they will be rooted and grounded and close enough to the lord that they will be able to sustain and survive and this school is equipping them that whichever direction

based on their passion of what they would like to do when god called them they are fit with the tool [Music] the spirit of prophecy talks about an army of young people who have been rightly trained if we're ever going to have an army of young people rightly trained we're going to have to have institutions that are training rightly not only are we training students stateside to go out and spread this message and carry it along with them but now we're sending students all over the world we

have students here from probably 16 different countries i believe that god has a plan for the work of education around the world and it is to establish schools like harvard hills academy in every country of the world [Music] much like the work at madison asi provides other entrepreneurial visionaries opportunities to make a difference in their communities by bringing the messages of the three angels to people in need of hope from a mission station in tanzania to a local business in boston here are some stories

that showcase asi's passion for cutting edge mission [Music] the idea of avocados didn't start as a big idea to begin with we noticed that the avocados here were very good the taste was superior we decided to try it on a small way we thought local market would like them and so we planted different varieties several hundred trees and as they were growing we just began to to realize that the world was very interested in avocados at this time and we we had this goal of putting in 10 000 trees

and by the time we accomplished that 10 000 trees the vision had grown to accomplish 500 acres and so on that 500 acres now we have about 62 000 trees planted they're growing and the lord is blessing we see a big harvest coming i have to say i'm not first and foremost an avocado farmer the only reason to be growing avocados and to be doing this business is because we want jesus to come and we need means in which to accomplish the spread of the gospel kipidoula mission is situated in the southern highlands of tanzania and i

like to think that we are here to spread the light like god would like us to through different means education especially and this takes on different forms like reaching our young children from the surrounding villages to the vulnerable youth those who have failed to progress in secondary school due to poverty or discrimination against the sexes whatever they may face but we also train older people to be lay missionaries in unentered areas of this country where it's so hard to raise up churches and start new companies for the

lord we have health evangelism training we do printing distributing of tracks and publishing books partnering with sister ministries as far as poland to be able to get these books out into the hands of people of this country because it's a program that is run by laymen mostly we are trying to do what we can to support it by generating some income from within the program itself for example for now we have embarked on the avocado program with so many people growing avocados the question comes to me over and over

are you not worried that the market is going to get saturated another providence of god is our climate is such that the avocados harvested here are off season you know god gave us the right elevation the right water the right temperatures that our avocados actually mature at a later stage than most of the avocados in the southern hemisphere so our prices never drop they're always fairly consistent all these years we all had wonderful avocados growing in our backyards never thinking that this could be that elusive

self-supporting industry that we've been searching for for so long every avocado produced supports mission work here whether it's a track that's being printed whether it's a student being received for free into our schools whether it's a lay missionary receiving training to go back into an unentered area to raise up a company avocados who would have thought avocados have taught me a lot about depending on god you know we we can we can apply the right fertilizers we can do the pruning we can

do all the right things and yet we are dependent on god and you know sometimes hail storms come through and all our food are damaged and we say why this lord and yet he has a plan and through it all he provides an opening a door we can sell our avocados one way or another and since the lord has opened this door we see that this project has the capability of not only supporting kibidoola and all its outreach endeavors but also helping to start and support other institutions not just in tanzania but throughout

africa and beyond [Music] yes we have food people come in people want food food connects people our goal is to teach to educate so when they come in for food we would have also have workshops uh so we listen to the needs of the the community and we're here to like serve and to teach him so we've been fortunate enough to have the space to be able to have large groups we've had up to 45 50 people in a given session as you go on and you start to know people they walk in the door you're

like i know your order let me help you and there are certain small things that you could do and they appreciate it and they're like you know you actually really helped me through my day and i think small things like that you build up to having a relationship that you can bring more of a personal stance of yourself to them it's not necessarily walking around oh i'm going to preach to this customer or i'm going to hand out this flyer i think reaching the marketplace means finding any

way that you can reach those who you come in contact with finding a way to connect with them and whether it's through a service you provide or a service they provide i feel like we're we're in a marketplace all the time really and i think that's a place where we're able to use whatever skills god gave us to reach out to people even if it's in the simplest of ways it doesn't have to be a bible study it doesn't have to be preaching reaching in the marketplace is really just using what god gave you

and what you're able to serve with and finding a way to reach versus waiting for people to come to you what i found here in this line of work is that you have so much time with people and they come to you and you build uh friendships long-lasting friendships and through that they are witnessing your work they're witnessing god's hands and in your business or ministry um and and i've witnessed it you know people have come back and have questions and are open their hearts are open

so for me um my experience has been that it's just through demonstration and through showing them what you're doing that people are paying attention when you're in your business or you're doing an entrepreneurial thing whatever you're doing i think what helps is when you just stop and focus on you know how can i minister to someone from a place of selflessness or how can i operate with selfless ambition and i think when you stop and think about that you're able to simplify

the value and any of the interactions you're even able to have in your workplace i'd say the dream for pulse is to be a place where people can come and not only expect to find good food or great juices but a place that they can build relationships with people and also find education and support people being able to come in and share their struggles with health and seeking help that has always been something that has been well received and it's something that we want to grow and expand on

and be able to provide more support and service even beyond the serving of food [Music] it's amazing how years of lifestyle have really degraded the human body but it's amazing how god has designed the body to respond to the things that he is designed to respond to and the lifestyle that is taught here is quickly uh responding in the anatomy of our body and it just changes things people's strength increases the numbers of course that we test in the lab all change and it's so encouraging as people look back just in

the 18 days and see how they have grown many of the people were blessed by sharing their struggles and when they see that certain problems that they have in uh their bodies are resolved by god's grace using natural remedies that is one of the greatest blessings for me to experience to see how god is healing people real time with natural remedies to go with them in the sound and sing with them especially scripture songs or hypnos i love to do that because i have seen that the atmosphere around them

changes people often come for the lifestyle diseases things like diabetes and high blood pressure and high cholesterol but you know people come and they don't realize sometimes that they're coming for another reason we have a very strong spiritual component to our program and we find that patients come and they when they leave they say you know i came because i thought i needed this this and this but i really found that getting a closer connection with god having a spiritual revival was the best thing for

me that we have a creator that made us that the creator understands the the best fuel for our physical equipment to run on and the best thoughts for our brains to be thinking about and an attitude of gratitude that is all part of the judeo-christian or biblical worldview one patient in particular that i'm thinking of came with a very very high triglyceride level over a thousand and they were taking medications and multiple supplements this patient told me that every sunday they would spend over an hour

bagging up the supplements for every day that they had to take during the next week and so we stopped the supplements we tapered them off their medications 18 days later when they left their triglycerides were lower than 200. so they dropped over 800 points in their triglycerides in just two weeks and that's coming off the medicines that's a total miracle from god you know i tell patients i've been here now for nine years and for nine years i have not taken a salary you know i am actually

the best paid person on campus because i get paid in miracles one of the things i hear a lot as chaplain is the guests are surprised how much prayer is had here you know you have a lot of people that are here that are hurting they have different ailments different issues and they'll go to the doctor and the doctor will pray with them and they're always very impressed that their doctor prays with him then they'll go to the hydrotherapist and the hydrotherapists will pray with him and counsel them and give them bible

verses and promises then the massage therapist will pray with them and give them promises and words of encouragement the nurses will pray with them and so by the time they come to me and have a counseling session in the morning i hear that a lot you know wow god is in this place [Music] [Music] [Music] eg pines is actually a place where people are transformed mentally physically and spiritually not only is it for the guests that come here for physical health but also for the people that come here

to be trained as gospel medical missionary evangelists we train people in three main elements we teach them preventative medicine natural remedies and gospel evangelism and the goal i believe is to yeah train medical missionaries to take the gospel to the rest of the world there's a few components to what we do we have our lifestyle center we have a missionary training program we train missionaries to be able to go out to the world and help people physically as well as bring the gospel to them

and then we have our health food store and vegan restaurant which is country life and that's a ministry that's actually in the the city where it's a center of influence people come and go from the idea is to do what jesus did which is preaching teaching and healing and he went about to to to meet the needs of the people with the purpose of bringing the gospel to their hearts country life is yucci pine's institute in the city their ministry to the city it's been there about 50 years it

actually began a year before youtube pines institute got started and it's a vegan vegetarian restaurant the health food store you can get we carry currently about 4 500 different products and we have an immense salad bar with over 50 options every day and a lot of vegan options including desserts for people to come in the main focus of our ministry there is really education we want people in the city to be able to know and to take advantage of food and information literature and it's a great opportunity for us at

the store to minister and to share these principles with people and one of the probably the greatest blessing that we receive is when we get testimonies from people when people come in and say i've made these changes i feel great i've lost weight i've got off my medication i can think clearer there's a lot of wonderful testimonies that we get sometimes on a daily basis and that is really the thing that encourages us to keep moving forward when we treat these individuals for their ailments their sicknesses

and they see the compassion they see us praying for them they see us petitioning the throne of grace for them it really opens their hearts to christ and and that is the end goal everything that we do here should and must involve christ and if we do that very work i believe that many people will accept our our beliefs will accept christ in their lives wildwood is a medical missionary training center for students that will hopefully circle the globe it's a ministry that trains people to be involved in health ministries and to

train people to travel around the world starting up these different health ministries but it's also very involved locally with our clinic our lifestyle center our natural food store we have an organic farm and so we're very engaged locally but we're also training people people come actually from around the world to wildwood to kind of get a vision for setting up a ministry kind of similar to that the main goal of this type of work is to prepare a people for the second coming of the lord

and as we we do that we minister to them health-wise as they are touched in their physical health aspects their hearts become more open to have a more vibrant experience with jesus christ we believe that he is the healer of all our diseases and he forgives all of our sins and so we help people to realign their lives and come closer to the lord through this whole program we're a center that tries to help you with your mind and your body so we teach classes like life alignment to help you understand

that you're greater than the failures that you've made you know what i'm saying you're not your disease as well as whatever disease you may have by god's grace we can be able to help in 11 or 22 days we have so we also have a store here we call it the wild natural food market we have students who are bible workers who end up working in the store as the checkout person sometimes i may walk into the store and maybe things i'm having a rough day things are not going well well when you have someone who is

able to see that hey this person looks a little bit sad and they're able to talk to the person they're able to even at times pray with the person that makes incredible difference that's thrilling to me it's just really exciting to be part of something that you know is having specific message commission to be done people are so stressed in the cities they are filled with a lot of pain a lot of suffering a lot of disease and to have just a sanctuary that they can come out to and be surrounded by loving

people you know so many people are are not loved in the world and to come to a facility where you're not treated like a number but you're you're treated like a person and you're prayed for you're surrounded with love and support i mean it it it it it impacts people's lives in a great way we see it all the time with um at the lifestyle guests to come through the people that come through the store and so just just its presence locally you know and and and also to the people that travel

there i mean it's it's changing people's lives one at a time [Music] [Music] taking a look at the work that is being done by asi pioneers around the world at present compels us to ask about the organization's past how did the madison school from its humble beginnings morph into a network of mission-minded entrepreneurs and professionals in order to answer this question we need to take a further look at the story of sutherland and mcghan and pick up where we left off looking at an image of two men facing down an

impossibly run chunk of land and taking a monumental leap of faith after some haggling and cajoling sutherland and mcgahn purchased the ferguson nelson property for eleven thousand dollars and took over possession in october of 1904 the school which they named the nashville agricultural and normal institute opened its doors to students not long after with a cohort of just 11 students sutherland and mcgann's unique vision for the school incorporated several different aspects including a school a

sanitarium and a farm it came to be known as the madison school and operated as a self-supporting organization and sought to train equip and deploy self-supporting missionaries the school operated like a large family where everyone was expected to participate in the daily operation of the farm it was quite normal to see megan the college dean operating a team of mules plowing the field while another teacher would drive a wagon into the nearby town to sell freshly churned butter made by e.a sutherland the

college president students who couldn't afford to pay cash for tuition could work on the farm in lieu of payments this meant that the college had to raise its funds by selling produce or by the generous donation of patrons students were expected to work six hours a day in one of the college industries in order to meet school expenses [Music] the majority of students coming to madison expected to be teachers or health workers in rural communities in the south and about a year after the school started the first mysteries went

out to set up their own outposts groups of madison alumni banded together and formed several small self-supporting colleges that were fashioned on the madison model these schools serve their local communities by offering numeracy and literacy classes for the local children as well as health education for the adults by 1915 there were 39 self-supporting groups spread across tennessee alabama and north carolina forming a network of innovative self-supporting missionary startups making inroads into their local

communities in many ways madison set the stage for innovation in mission in the seventh day adventist church and not only that it also facilitated and empowered lay driven mission initiatives years later when adventist laymen's services and industries better known as asi was formed it too embraced these same core values mission innovation and self-sacrificing commitment all driven by an empowered and well-equipped laity at the heart of the madison model were a few key principles the importance of

faith in god's word and sacrifice the importance of innovation and entrepreneurship within the context of mission and the importance of an empowered and engaged church membership readily sharing christ in the marketplace when you look at the madison model you cannot help but think about the modern day startups and entrepreneurships in what ways was it similar to these creative industries and businesses in what ways was it different and what can we learn today about the importance of innovation in mission

but there's another aspect we need to consider thrown into this mix of innovation in mission are the inevitable statistics that we need to face according to the united nations 55 of the world's population now live in urban areas or cities that's just over half of the world's population crammed into the confines of major cities but there's more almost 58 of the world's population now has access to the internet in fact we find ourselves going online more and more in search of information and

answers and finally only 50 percent of the world's population have access to adequate healthcare so in a nutshell just over half of us live in cities we have more access to the internet than we ever have but almost no access to adequate healthcare given all of this and considering our unique mission as seventh day adventist how can innovation in mission prepare us to meet the changing face of global society how can these statistics prepare us to meet the millions who so desperately need to hear the gospel

without innovation often mission is less effective without mission innovation simply is human endeavors so when you blend innovation and mission you have the best of both worlds you expand the gospel through innovation but the function of innovation is not innovation for innovation's sake we're not seeking for relevance we're seeking for success in the kingdom of god well asi is a wonderful organization that has as its main focus reaching people with the precious gospel of christ and the message that

has been entrusted to seventh-day adventists i believe that asi is uniquely positioned to help that happen because our focus our niche if you want to say it that way is on the business and professional and ministry people we're not here to address every single seventh-day adventist we're not trying to be the personal ministries department of the seventh-day adventist church we are uniquely positioned to talk to the business people the professional people and the lay ministry people i believe that that group of people

have passion and energy and ideas to support the mission of the seventh-day adventist church and how is asi making a difference in these areas let's pause and look at some asi projects happening around the world [Music] riverside's in a very unique location we're south of the capital city of lusaka and we're actually right on the river right at the base of the cliffs that location provides us with ample water on the edge of an area that's quite air and very bush land and so we've got beautiful soils

and because of the dry season during that dry season with the irrigation it's almost like being able to grow in the biggest greenhouse you've ever imagined to give an idea this year we'll produce 5 million pounds of bananas and you know that that funding is what allows us to to bring students and they their teachers are paid for so the cost for them is honestly in most cases less than the food that they'll eat while they're here which is really an exciting thing you know it reminds me back to

some of the stories of madison and the students coming with five dollars and depositing doing their five dollars when they leave we're not quite there yet but there's a significant contribution from industry to the educational process here so riverside is really a combination of things we do a lot of education both for adults and children and then we also focus a lot on evangelism those really go hand in hand um so that's the core of what we do and in the process obviously we have a

farm and we grow a lot of bananas wheat soybeans and other crops to help that happen it started as a small few fields few houses near the river you know the property is 1200 hectares for those who are in the states you know almost 3 000 acres and it started there they were growing some maize some wheat some some sorghum um in small small amounts running water up a hill down through these ditches to try to irrigate and then at some point one of the guys said hey let's try bananas and riverside was actually the

first place in zambia to to try growing bananas commercially and did it in a small scale but the first first to do it and um yeah maybe 10 hectares of land being done at the max at that period of time and so today we're up to 38 hectares of bananas so one of the things that bananas really contributes obviously is income but you think of for example a lot of self-supporting projects we call ourselves self-supporting but really donor funded projects and one of the things i really like here is that we're

moving towards the place where we'll be completely self-supporting from uh from an income standpoint and places like asi have been you know immensely generous with with riverside over the years for example the bananas that are behind me they helped with a donation one year for fifty thousand dollars and that's a lot of money to plant bananas and you could build churches or do something else with that but when you realize that for every dollar they gave the ministry has received more than six

point six six dollars for every dollar that was given um because it's it's some leverage through the the industry of bananas and so bananas literally uh exponentially multiply the value of the donor funds that are given here we're the second largest employer in the district employing more than 150 people full-time here on the farm with the school with the program and with that comes significant sponsorships in education um obviously money for food clothing but also we've been able to impact people through

the training program that's connected to the to the work you know the the access to education obviously helps if you're reading the package on fertilizer you're planting maize locally but it's also unlocks the possibility of going anywhere i mean one of our students went on to go to harvard and so you just realize the stepping points that you give someone is unlimited you you unlock the potential for their future by giving them education and so seeing students you know more than 100 students are

sponsored 100 free education out of the village kids who were getting failing education um otherwise are are graduating with top marks the school while we're small is the highest graduation rate in the entire district and so that's really exciting and so now adding the secondary school in we're going to be able to continue that through that partnership with child impact the the advantage of having the students here is that when they leave after graduating after their five months of training courses are finished then

they go home they take more knowledge than they had when they came and they become missionaries in their own communities in 1900 1903 there were less than two thousand seventh-day adventists in all of southern africa and today there's more than a million adventists in zambia and you know that's really i think a testament to the to the opportunity of combining church work with self-supporting work close to together we've been able to with partnership with asi build hundreds of churches working with people like light

bearers to have literature across this country and the results can be seen and now you have you have one of the largest populations of adventists but yet you still have hundreds of villages with not a single adventist in it that still need to be reached and so you see this work continuing before us so the vision is really to see people um combining business and ministry together because you know we're told that business and ministry are not two separate things they're one and i think sometimes we get confused and as young

people we tell young people hey you know we're going to go to heaven and we get the idea it's harps and clouds but it's really going to be being creative god's creative and i believe throughout all eternity we're going to be able to be creative and here we get the chance to impact people who will be able to be creative with us for eternity creating new things and and so i think the the real purpose for being here is to bring more souls to the kingdom of god through the different aspects with

which we can impact people i'm andrew schmidt and i'm from lexington kentucky we have a small business that we make machines for the textile industry we make machines that put on buttons and snaps onto garments pants tarps my father actually started in new york city with his father and mother and they didn't have hardly anything but they worked really hard saved and started a little machine shop in their basement and my grandfather was very sharp mechanical and he and my father was able to design

small machines and get some business that grew into larger accounts and business and eventually moved to lexington think my parents placed a desire in our hearts my brother and i we saw growing up dad's passion for sharing christ dad took us when we were younger out sharing literature and we would go door to door and actually knock on the door and someone would come to the door and he would offer a book and offer for bible studies and there were times that they took him up on that offer and we

would go back every week obviously as i grew older i realized as well that in the business they always took advantage of being able to talk to people or share a little book here or there when my father when we started sending equipment out he set a lot of it up and so as he was in the factory he would you know have opportunities to share books with the mechanics or with the owner so he's always seen that as just a way to pay it forward for god i mean god is basically in essence gave him or them

the business the brains and everything and i think through his example he showed us that whenever you can you want to give back to god you know we have on our music that's put on hold we have amazing grace and christian music that's usually playing and i've picked up the phone before and the lady on the other end said you know what that was amazing grace i haven't heard that since i was a little girl my grandma used to take me to church and i haven't been to church since i was little and it made me

realize i need to get back to church so just you know those are simple simple things you can do but they make an impact and with god's blessing they reach the right people we have placed this business into god's hands and he brings people and i feel like we have the opportunity and also the responsibility to let them know who jesus is and what he has done for them in other words it's not so much important what i say but what they see in me that's important god has brought us where we are

okay he has helped us he has given us the business and the opportunities and so wherever we we have that business we share what we what he's given us the way we look at our business is we realize that god is blessed whether it was through my grandfather and father in the ideas and the engineering um in the marketing and getting customers all that is not because we're so smart but it's god's blessing and so whether you have a you're a doctor or a car manufacturer or whatever you do

i would say you know god gave you that god blessed you with that and the least you can do is give back we have a sphere of influence that other people don't have we have relationships with our customers with our vendors that our pastor doesn't have an evangelist does not have and god asks us to take the tools right where we are not lay them down and go to church and work for him but right where we are to pick up our whatever we have in our hand and be able to use that to share for him [Music]

when you look at the days of israel samuel established the schools of the prophets for the purpose of training young men to keep the knowledge of the living god alive i believe we're living in serious times and that the lord is getting ready to come back but there needs to be young and old who will sound a clear message calling hearts for repentance and for faithfulness and i believe that's one reason our schools are established washington hills is located in sort of like the foothills of the ozark mountains and so it's just

a setting where we really have our minds on the creator who made all these things watch the hills to me has been an experience where i've been in an environment where i'm strong with people who are excited about jesus i learned a lot of things about how to be more well-rounded and how i approach life so part of the reason in college i went here is i wanted to live outside of my comfort zone and one of the things i had to do was canvassing and that helped me to learn how to speak about religious

things in all kinds of different ways with all kinds of different people now i work at watson hills academy so i'm more in the teacher role and one of the things that we're trying to do for our students that come through is to help them have an education of both the mind body and spirit so it's not just you know we're teaching them academics but they're actually learning practical skills that they can take in life as students are learning to deal with problems and intricacies and to

discern things that they need to be involved in it carries over those skills that they develop carries over into practical life and into their educational time the young people are like swords in the hands of a mighty warrior right and jesus is the mighty warrior but if the sword is not sharp it does no good you know if you want to keep our young people we need to send them out but in order to send them out we need to prepare them for what's out there we want them to leave this school with the

experience or the knowledge of how to use their profession to reach out to those souls that they come in contact with a lot of young people has been having a conversion experience but they have not learned they have so many gaps and we have the opportunity here to help them grow and solidify their beliefs and not only that but also to develop skills that can be used in a professional world so in the college we have four programs we have a business degree two year and four year program and we also have

education both elementary education secondary education and then we have a music program that we just started music majors and also in the religion department we have three programs we have the associate degree two-year degree for personal evangelism where we train bible workers and canvassing leaders and then in our four-year program we're training either pastors or pastoral evangelists or missionaries we have the biblical studies where you can have a minor in business and other things and

then our theology program that has the biblical languages that you can dig more deeply into god's word they have a work study program here also so we not only have educational classes where we learn things in the classroom but we also have on practical work where we work on the farm we do woodworking we do all types of different work and so it's really nice that we can take what we learn in the classroom and put it to practical work here on campus our work study program but also on the canvassing field with ministering

to people at the last days of earth's history we are told that we are going to have an army of youth that are rightly trained that are going to take the gospel to the to the world in that generation we're living on the cusp of that time i believe messages to young people says as a young person what are your aspirations do you have high aspirations and many times we can be like oh it's not good to have high aspirations being president or being in congress but when you were able to have christ as

the focus of i want to work in the government or i want to work in enterprises the gospel is able to go in places where many times it's not available to go yes we do need these schools around the world it is a necessity and i believe that the lord will smile on us greatly if we make this a priority today asi is a force for mission around the world from its humble beginnings asi has grown as an organization that empowers god's workers in 1947 it began when the expanding network of self-supporting

institutions that had been inspired by the madison school joined together to form the association of seventh-day adventist self-supporting institutions they were subsequently organized as a department at the general conference when it was first organized asi membership consisted solely of educational and healthcare organizations over the years membership grew to include businesses adventist entrepreneurs and professionals this expansion and diversification led to the organization's name being changed to

adventist laymen's services and industries in 1979. like sutherland and mcghan over a century ago there are many committed visionary lay people within the adventist church who have a genuine desire to hasten the soon return of jesus through concerted missionary effort like the apostle paul their tent makers occupying the marketplaces and thoroughfares around the world when paul was in rome he quietly plied his trade in his small house entertaining a steady stream of guests eager to know more about jesus

today like the apostle paul there are many who are willing to use their skills and the tools they have at their disposal not only to make a living but to win souls for the kingdom asi exists to provide these individuals and organizations with the support they need to flourish and grow through the networking and training at our annual convention financial assistance and mentorship we seek to nurture innovation and mission in the adventist church in many ways asi still encapsulates the vision and mission that

were the hallmarks of madison college and its founders so sharing christ in the marketplace is the motto of asi every business has its own marketplace we have our own marketplace here as a ministry we have a nursing home we have a farm we have a bakery we have students here students are part of our market we want to see them engaged with christ in the gospel commission but the community is part of our market as well as we engage with the community through providing services we want to do it in such a way

that we're effectively sharing the good news of christ with them while engaging in business with them ministry has to take place beyond the walls of a church and wherever you are wherever you live wherever you work wherever you go to school god wants you to do ministry and you can do ministry you can be equipped through asi to learn how do you share christ as a student in your school how do you share christ in your work as a business professional as a medical professional as a doctor as a as a person in industries as an artist

as a graphic designer there's amazing ways that you can learn to share christ asi becomes the pulse the very heart of what adventism is all about it is a lay movement and i'm reminded that a statement of ellen white where she said until laity and ministry join hands the work of god on earth will never be finished and so it's vitally important asi is committed to taking the three angels message to all the world in this generation every project that it undertakes every individual that it

equips and empowers is a single link in a long chain towards this single purpose [Music] [Music] my name is denzel mcneilles i'm from dodds center minnesota and i am a banker by trade me as business being a businessman i thought that my first job was to make money and give it to the church and let the professionals do the work i didn't realize that there's this whole opportunity of sharing christ in your own marketplace and so i just get inspired by my own brothers and sisters that are involved

in business that are doing not just giving money but they're giving and don't get wrong you need to give you need a support to church you need to be giving your money because that's part of that's part of who you are but the real focal point is what are you doing besides giving your money that's where it really comes down to where are you sharing christ where are you giving your own personal bible say where are you being involved because let's face it lord lord doesn't near money because he

has it all right what he needs is us and what we need to do is be giving not just of our money but of our time we're a family-owned bank so we're commun a community bank and we mainly focus on small businesses our main focus here is to take care of our customers and to be a light in this community for uh for jesus i believe the lord is using this business i believe that we as business people have an opportunity to share christ where we are and i believe every person is put in a position to reach

people that no one else can reach on the banking side people tend to be a little more vulnerable when they're discussing their financials and so they'll let their guard down a little bit that can filter into other types of discussions obviously religion would be a component of that because we call these divine appointments these opportunities that he gives us to share i feel that if god calls you into a place where you are working with the public that he does expect you to share him well sharing christ in a

marketplace can't just be a meaning it has to be a lifestyle in what we do as a family i always make it a point of when a customer asks me how are you doing because that's kind of a standard action i say well i'm doing fantastic but it's going to get better and they'll say well how does it get better and fantastic and i say well the lord's coming and so i know with the lord coming it's going to get better than that or another person will ask well how are you doing i said i'm very blessed i had a customer

say to that to me goes that's right you're a christian i really would like to talk to you about your faith can we can we meet and talk about your faith and so just by answering questions like that in a way that creates opportunity for opening the doors i think is very very important for us to open doors to be able to share the gospel our friend dwight hildebrand says it best he says once you share christ it's like a disease and there is no cure because you want to do it over and over

and over again because it's such a joy [Music] spider controls is a company that designs and manufactures electronic controls for different industries like rvs boats specialty vehicles and equipment our company started humble beginnings back in 2000 and started in our garage and basement very humble beginnings since that time our company has grown to provide more of this type of product to the industries that we serve than any other industry of its kind and it's been just amazing to see how god

has provided not only the opportunities to grow and to learn but also the the people that make up really what spider controls is the the difference that we feel that spider controls offers is in our industry is the way that our team cares about our our customers and that is a culture that has has definitely developed here at spider controls over the years we believe that our our highest calling is is to give god created us in a way that he wanted us to be giving and as we we give of ourselves that is

when we are happiest we see that in the life of christ and how he lived his life giving every day in what he would do in his ministry on this earth and that's an opportunity that we have here in our company to try and develop that culture curtis is really big on mission trips and promoting outreach for the community he actually was my sponsor for my mission trips i got to go to the philippines on a medical mission that was very special and life-changing for me we also do work bees here at work so if

anybody needs a hand or they know somebody in the community over the winter we did some snow shoveling so we would just go and surprise people and have their driveways shoveled you know it's interesting how the culture of living to give is gone beyond the walls of our business here and it's something that has has definitely impacted our customers as we really have that attitude and that focus on giving we want to give that best service that we possibly can we do design and manufacture electronic controls and

products for these different industries but it's actually the service that has been what has set our company apart in the industry and that service comes from a desire to make sure that we're giving the best to our customers and that that attitude pervades all of our our team members that are connecting with customers and it's interesting how that opens up opportunities to not only be a witness and and that professionalism and that desire to give our absolute best to our customers is

such a powerful witness in itself but also your customers then have a much higher level of trust in you and it opens up opportunities for conversations that go much beyond business we have the opportunity as your customers develop that trust in you they open up to things that are going on in their lives and the opportunities that come out of that to to pray together and to maybe just share a need that they have in their lives that we can lift up in prayer and even bring back to our team to pray about has been an amazing

opportunity to bring christ into our marketplace and so we're grateful that god has has provided those opportunities to make those connections with the customers that we serve [Music] in 2011 a study was conducted for every 10 000 people in india there are only 20 health workers that includes physicians nurses and therapists it's a big problem in india [Music] i had a privilege of going and attending wildwood lifestyle center in georgia usa and i did my six-month program and advanced course there which has really

transformed and touched my life and i could see how powerful this medical missionary work could be used to reach out to other people and touching their life and changing their life and i see people coming with so much of suffering in the lifestyle centers their life have been transformed in a short time over 10 days or 21 days and when they go back i could see such an impact and i wanted to have the same thing happening right here in india where there is so much of suffering in disease people are actually

dying with a sickness which they could easily prevent or easily they can reverse and it's not because the resources are lacking but because the basic knowledge is not there for them so one of our dreams as we work with light and health coaching in india is that more of this basic healthcare knowledge of how to take care of our bodies what foods to eat simple remedies of hydrotherapy and massage for the people who work all day and night and have tired bodies all these things that we have grown up with and we are exposed to

can also be shared with them through the training of light material that way they can also live healthier lives and they will also have true and proven methods that god has given us to have more whole and fulfilling lives that are free from the suffering and disease that the people here face we train and eq people to become as medical missionaries we have them go and establish their own center and build network among all the other ministries as well that are doing light affiliated schools or institutions

our vision in restoration healthcare in lifestyle coaching is to branch out to every state of india nepal and bhutan to make health care accessible to everyone that is in need of help we want our clients to be personally connected with our coaches that we can able to impact their life not just on physical level even in their spiritual and also in their mental aspect as well this is an enormous field that needs to be reached the only way we could reach is christ method alone the savior mingle with men

as one desire they are good he showed his sympathy for them minister to their needs and won their confidence then he paid them follow me and that is exactly what we want to do with the help of our trainees and our centers [Music] in many ways a seventh-day adventist church is not just a church it is a movement which implies it is made up of a group of like-minded individuals always moving forward always innovating always breaking new ground in search of new frontiers [Music] our calling as adventists is clear the

three angels message to all the world in this generation and the methods we are to use while being in harmony with the bible and the spirit of prophecy must always stay abreast of the changing world around us we are called to straddle the line between biblical principle and progressive innovation all in pursuit of a single global vision the pioneers of this church straddled this line successfully breaking barriers wherever they went james and ellen white stephen haskell jay and andrews anna knight percy mcgann ed sutherland the

list goes on they were all faithful courageous indomitable and committed they were all innovators and missionaries in equal measure [Music] in matthew 28 verse 19 jesus gives each of us the great commission he commanded us to go into all the world and make disciples in his name the commission was not given so much to the church at large but to each one of us as individuals it is a call to total member involvement a call to unequivocal mission mindedness it is a call to action [Music] as you contemplate the work of those who

have gone before ask yourself what you can do in the work that lies ahead follow the calling that jesus has made on your life and go forward committed and courageous an innovator and a missionary ready to turn the world upside down for god's glory [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] my [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
