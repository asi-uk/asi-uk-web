## The Roots of ASI: Madison College

The story of ASI begins on a warm summer's day in June 1904, when a steamboat called the *Morning Star* pushed away from the landing dock in Nashville, Tennessee, and headed up the Cumberland River. On board was a small group of explorers, among them Ellen White and her two sons, Edson and Willie White. Beside the helmsman stood E.A. Sutherland, an educator, innovator, and missionary trailblazer. They were on an expedition to find suitable land for a new kind of missionary training school.

Sutherland and his partner Percy Magan had just left their positions at Emmanuel Missionary College in Berrien Springs, Michigan, to embark on this new venture. When the *Morning Star* broke down a few miles out of Nashville, the group found themselves providentially beside the Ferguson-Nelson farm near Madison -- a large but unpromising spread of land that had previously served as a slave trader's headquarters before falling into disrepair.

Ellen White urged Sutherland and Magan to purchase the property, telling them she had seen it in vision. They were reluctant -- the land was rocky, overgrown, and would cost $12,000, of which they had only half. After spending an entire day in prayer, they were filled with a peace and courage that never left them. They purchased the property for $11,000, and in October 1904 the Nashville Agricultural and Normal Institute -- soon known simply as Madison College -- opened its doors to its first cohort of just eleven students.

## A New Model for Mission

Madison College was unlike anything the Adventist Church had seen. It combined education, healthcare, and agriculture into a single self-supporting operation. The school functioned like a large family: it was not unusual to see Magan, the college dean, ploughing fields with a team of mules, while Sutherland, the president, churned butter for sale in the nearby town. Students who could not pay tuition in cash worked six hours a day on the farm or in one of the college industries instead.

This model of self-supporting mission produced remarkable results. Within a year of the school's founding, graduates began going out to establish their own outposts. Groups of Madison alumni banded together to form small self-supporting institutions fashioned on the same model -- schools that served their local communities by offering literacy classes for children and health education for adults. By 1915, there were 39 such self-supporting groups spread across Tennessee, Alabama, and North Carolina, forming a growing network of lay-driven missionary enterprises.

At the heart of the Madison model were several key principles that would come to define ASI: faith in God's word and willingness to sacrifice, innovation and entrepreneurship within the context of mission, and the vital importance of an empowered and engaged church membership sharing Christ in everyday life.

## The Formation of ASI

In 1947, the expanding network of self-supporting institutions inspired by Madison College joined together under the guidance of the General Conference to form the Association of Seventh-day Adventist Self-Supporting Institutions, or ASI. At the time, ASI membership consisted solely of educational and healthcare organisations.

During this official formation meeting, frequent reference was made to Ellen White's statement: *"The work of God in this earth can never be finished until the men and women comprising our church membership rally to the work, and unite their efforts with those of ministers and church officers"* (Gospel Workers, p. 352). This conviction -- that lay people and church leaders must work hand in hand -- became the foundational principle of the new organisation.

Over the following decades, ASI membership grew to include businesses, Adventist entrepreneurs, and professionals from all walks of life. To better reflect this diverse membership, the organisation's name was changed in 1979 to Adventist-laymen's Services and Industries, with the motto: *Sharing Christ in the Marketplace*.

## ASI Today

Today, ASI is a global force for mission. From banana farms in Zambia that fund education and evangelism, to lifestyle health centres in Tennessee and Georgia, to small businesses in Kentucky and Minnesota whose owners see every customer interaction as a divine appointment -- ASI members around the world are combining their professional skills with a passion for sharing the gospel.

ASI exists to network, equip, and empower these individuals and organisations. Through annual conventions, financial assistance, and mentorship, ASI nurtures innovation in mission within the Adventist Church. In many ways, the organisation still embodies the vision and values that were the hallmarks of Madison College and its founders: faith, innovation, self-sacrifice, and a deep commitment to sharing Christ wherever life takes you.

## ASI in the United Kingdom

The ASI concept was introduced to the Adventist Church in the British Isles in 1983 by the then British Union Conference President, Harold Calkins, and his Vice-President, John Arthur. They invited ASI members from the United States to meet with interested business and professional lay people in Leicester. During that weekend, the first overseas chapter of ASI was formed -- a historic milestone for the movement.

In 1990, the UK chapter's name was changed to the Adventist Business and Professionals Association. However, following the formation of ASI Europe in 1998, it was decided in 2006 to change the name back to ASI UK, bringing it into line with other European chapters.

Over the years, ASI UK has been actively involved in evangelistic initiatives and humanitarian projects, maintaining strong links with ADRA and the British Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The chapter conducts workshops and seminars and continues to attract young professionals and those starting out in business to the Association, ensuring that the next generation of Adventist lay people are equipped and inspired to share Christ in their marketplaces.
